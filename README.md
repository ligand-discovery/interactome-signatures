# Interactome Signatures
Interactome signature modeling for the [Ligand Discovery](https://ligand-discovery.ai) project. This repository contains a monolithic [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) used to generate interactome signatures from fully-functionalized fragment screening data.

## Usage

* [Download](https://ligand-discovery.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/interactome-signatures/data.zip) and unzip the `data` directory in the current folder
* Open the `notebooks/InteractomeSignatures.ipynb` notebook and install the necessary dependencies, as specified in the first executable cell.
* A `results` folder will be generated. If you want to avoid the previous steps, you directly can [download precalculated](https://ligand-discovery.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/interactome-signatures/results.zip) results.

## Learn more
The current notebook is the result of iterative exploration of different **topic modeling** techniques. If you are interested in preliminary results and notebooks, please reach out to [miquel@ersilia.io](mailto:miquel@ersilia). Previous topic modeling exploration is available in an [archived repository]().
