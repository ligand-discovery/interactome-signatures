# Interactome Signatures
Interactome signature modeling for the [Ligand Discovery](https://ligand-discovery.ai) project. This repository contains a monolithic [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) used to generate interactome signatures from fully-functionalized fragment screening data.

## Usage
Open the `InteractomeSignatures.ipynb` notebook and install the necessary dependencies, as specified in the first executable cell.


## Learn more

The current notebook is the result of iterative exploration of different **topic modeling** techniques. If you are interested in preliminary results and notebooks, please reach out to [miquel@ersilia.io](mailto:miquel@ersilia).
